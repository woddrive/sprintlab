              <h5 class="mt-4">The Design Sprint is a Highly Flexible Framework!</h5>
              <p>
                Always remember that one of the key strengths of the design sprint is its adaptability, allowing teams to adjust the duration and core activities based on 
                their specific needs and constraints. Whether working with a tight deadline, limited resources, or complex user requirements, <strong>the design 
                  sprint can be customized to accommodate different scenarios</strong>. The conventional 5-day duration of the sprint is not a steadfast rule; it can be 
                condensed or extended based on the project's urgency or complexity. Similarly, the core activities within each sprint day can be modified or 
                supplemented to address the unique challenges and goals of the project. This flexibility ensures that the design sprint remains a versatile and 
                effective framework, capable of driving innovation and delivering user-centric solutions across a wide range of customer and product design scenarios.
